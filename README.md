#  Employee Attrition Prediction with Power BI & Machine Learning

##  Overview
This repository contains a project focused on predicting and analyzing **employee attrition** using **Python (Machine Learning)** and **Power BI (Data Visualization)**.  
The project aims to help HR departments identify potential attrition risks and design data-driven strategies to improve employee retention.

The dataset includes employee information such as:
- Demographics (Gender, Age, Education)
- Job attributes (Department, Job Role, Salary, Tenure)
- Performance metrics and satisfaction levels  

The analysis involves:
- **Building a Decision Tree model** for attrition prediction  
- **Evaluating model accuracy** using a confusion matrix  
- **Creating an interactive Power BI dashboard** for visual storytelling and insights

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib)
- **Power BI Desktop**
- **ReportLab** for PDF generation
- **SHAP** for feature importance interpretation

---

##  Key Insights
- Employees in *Sales* and *R&D* departments show higher attrition rates.  
- Job satisfaction, monthly income, and years at company are key attrition predictors.  
- The Decision Tree model achieved **~82% accuracy**.  
- Strategic HR interventions (e.g., career growth programs, compensation review) can help reduce turnover.
